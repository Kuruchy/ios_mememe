# ios_mememe
MeMeMe iOS App - Project for the iOS Developer Nanodegree at Udacity

App that enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme, and share that meme on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email. In this project, sent memes will appear in a tab view with two tabs: a table view and a collection view.

## What I learned

1. To set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
2. To build tables with datasources and delegates
3. To create custom table view cells
4. To implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views
